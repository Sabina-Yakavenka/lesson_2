                            <p>A hobby is something people like doing in their free time. I like watching films.  I watch them in the cinema or at home. I prefer to go to the cinema with my friends â€” it's more fun to watch a film together and then discuss it afterwards.</p>

                            <p>I have several hobbies. But my major hobby is looking after my pets. I am fond of animals. I think nothing else in our life could supply us with more pleasant emotions than our pets. It is so pleasant to know that somebody needs you and loves you only for the fact that you exist.</p>

                            <p>My hobby is traveling. In the not so long time of my life, I have already managed to travel quite a lot.While traveling, you can learn a lot of new things. This expands the worldview of the person himself, makes him look at the world with different eyes and become spiritually richer.</p>
