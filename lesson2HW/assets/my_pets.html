                        <p>I have several hobbies. But my major hobby is looking after my pets. I am fond of animals. I think nothing else in our life could supply us with more pleasant emotions than our pets. It is so pleasant to know that somebody needs you and loves you only for the fact that you exist. Your friends can betray you, but your pets â€” never.
                        Now let me tell you about my pets. I have two cats and a dog. One cat is male. Its name is Ryzhyk. 
                        He is 5 years old. His fur is reddish-brown. He likes to play with a ball. Actually, he has a dog-like behaviour. He performs different tricks and prefers the company of the dog to the company of the cat. He won several prizes at different Cat Shows.</p>
