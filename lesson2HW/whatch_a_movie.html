                        <p>A hobby is something people like doing in their free time. I like watching films.  I watch them in the cinema or at home. I prefer to go to the cinema with my friends â€” it's more fun to watch a film together and then discuss it afterwards.
                            But I can't say that I often go to the cinema. I do it once or twice a month. At the same time, I can watch films at home whenever I have free time, after I do my homework and help my mum with household chores.
                            I enjoy watching adventure films, historical dramas, science fiction films and thrillers. I think I watch films because they let me live in a fantasy world created by script writers, film directors, actors and many other people. Besides, I believe there is a message in every good film that can help to change our lives for the better.</p>
